# ADANTE_GARCIA_AUTOMATED_ESSAY_SCORING_CS160P


This is a requirement for CS160P where exploratory data analysis and using machine learning models are presented
All essay sets were used for training the machine learning model
.
.
In using the models for evaluating all essay sets/topics using cohen kappa, simple linear regression model is effective while using multiple features, and Support Vector classifier being notably poor
.
Furthermore, by using hyperparameters on Grid Search CV on the same features does not have much of an improvement from the mentioned model with the highest performance (Simple Linear Regression)
